# WordPunch


This is just a starting draftâ€”many elements are totally adjustable

## Current Game Settings
Letters are randomly spawned on the inner face of an invisible cylinder surrounding the player, at a fixed radius from the origin.

**TBD:**
**Player Movement**
**Word Selection Mechanism**
**Scoring**
**Objective**

## Potential Adjustable Features
Just personal thoughts... feel free to add

 - Letter Spawning Variations
	  -   Letters spawn around a fixed radius from the origin, creating a circular arena. **(Current)**
	  -   open-world spawning - letters appear randomly in an expansive area, allowing players to walk around and discover letters freely.
  - Word Selection Mechanism 
	  - Any letter combination can be selected, with no restriction on consecutive letters.
	  - require consecutive selection (player can use finger to select by drawing stroke)
  - Reward Metric
	  - Longer words grant higher scores?
	  - special character?
	  - target word? (then probably can't do consecutive selection since the letters are spawned randomly)
  - Selected word handle
	  - just disappear
	  - refill
	  - mimic candy crush (then the setting should be panel-based, refill from top)
  - Other
	  - Time limit
	  - difficulty level
